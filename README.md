# gd/sa with rastringin and other functions
# plotting avg error (distance to actual minima) across multiple iterations for each algorithm
# using gd/sa for machine learning
# don't usually have the actual function, just a set of data that represents the function's input and associated output
# so far minimizing a function without any meaning, but in ml we want to create a model of a function based on its input and output data
# in other words, we are trying to minimize the error of our model with respect to the actual function
# if we could use a function that describes this error, we could apply gd/sa to it to minimize our model's error
# now the function we are minimizing has actual meaning
